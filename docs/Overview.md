## Overview

### Purpose

The Creature Creator is a program that will take different creatures, along with optional defined environments, and simulate the evolution and interaction of the creatures over time within their ecosystems. I plan to start with a more basic simulation that simulates the offspring in single generation increments, but ultimately would like a fully interactive simulation in which the user can watch the simulation in real-time and change any simulation variables in real-time. My main goal for this project is to become more confident in not just my C++ programming, but also get aquainted with using the SFML libraries for a GUI. This is primarily a school project, but I want to try to make it more polished and 'feature complete'. I am aiming for this to be more of a creature simulator in which different creatures can interact in a modeled environment, compete for resources, etc.

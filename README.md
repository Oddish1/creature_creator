# Creature Creator

This project is a pretty simple program. The user sets the attributes of two parent creatures and then you are given what a possible child creature of those two parents might look like. This is originally being created for a school project. I may continue work on it in the future to create some sort of evolution simulation given two parent creatures, but we'll see.

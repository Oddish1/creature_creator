# Creature Creator

## Overview

The Creature Creator is a pretty simple program that will take two different user-defined creatures, and randomly generate a combination of the two creatures. It also provides some randomly generated statistics for the new creature.

## Motivation

My main goal for this project is to become more confident in not just my C++ programming, but also get aquainted with using the SFML libraries for a GUI. This is primarily a school project, but I want to try to make it a bit more polished and 'feature complete'.
